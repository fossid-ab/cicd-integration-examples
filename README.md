# About this Repo

This repo contains a collection of CI/CD Integration templates that show how FossID Workbench and FossID Toolbox can be added to your CI/CD pipelines. This is an ongoing effort by the Customer Success Team to have ready-made examples for various ecosystems. 

Please note these examples are not complete pipelines. They are intended to show only how FossID can be added to your own.

## FossID Workbench
For Workbench, we provide examples using the [Workbench Agent](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-agent) both as a Python script and as a container.

We also provide some examples using our [API Sample Scripts](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-api-samples).

### Prerequisites
To use these examples, you need access to FossID Workbench, a User Account, and the User's API Token.

To run the Workbench Agent container, you need an Image Pull Secret for our Quay Registry. If you don't have one, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com) to request one.

## FossID Toolbox
For Toolbox, we provide examples using the Toolbox Container Image. 

### Prerequisites
To use these examples, you need a Scan Token for the FossID Knowledge Base. You can retrieve the token from your account's [Evaluation Portal](https://vault-eu.foss.id/eval) or [Delivery Portal](https://vault-eu.foss.id/delivery).

To run the Toolbox container, you need an Image Pull Secret for our Quay Registry. If you don't have one, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com) to request one.
