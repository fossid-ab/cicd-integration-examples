# GitHub Actions Examples!

These YAML files show you how to add FossID to your GitHub Actions workflows. 
The following examples are available:

1. toolbox-diffscan.yml - uses the Toolbox DiffScan to compare two REFs during a Pull Request
2. wb-agent-python.yml - shows how you can set up the Workbench Agent to scan when code is pushed to a branch
3. wb-agent-container.yml - an implementation of the same Workbench Agent workflow, using the container instead
