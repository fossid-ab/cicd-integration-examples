# CI/CD Examples for Workbench

These templates show you how to integrate Workbench into CI/CD workflows. Most of these use the [Workbench Agent](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-agent) for easy integration. Some examples also leverage the [API Sample Scripts](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-api-samples) where it makes sense.

### Prerequisites
To use these examples, you need access to FossID Workbench, a User Account, and the User's API Token.

To run the Workbench Agent container, you need an Image Pull Secret for our Quay Registry. If you don't have one, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com) to request one.
