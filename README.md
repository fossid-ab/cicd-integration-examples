# About this Repo

The purpose of this repo is to share examples of how FossID Workbench and FossID Toolbox can be added to your CI/CD pipelines.

Please note these examples are not complete pipelines. They are intended to show only how FossID can be added to your own.


## FossID Workbench

For Workbench, we provide examples using the [Workbench Agent](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-agent). There are examples for running the Python Script directly and for running the container.

We also provide examples of using the Workbench API from our [API Sample Scripts](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-api-samples).


### Prerequisites

To use these examples, you'll need access to FossID Workbench, a User Account, and the User's API Token.

To run the Workbench Agent container, you'll also need an Image Pull Secret for our Quay Registry. If you don't have one, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com) to request one.

## FossID Toolbox

For Toolbox, we'll provide examples using the Toolbox Container Image. 

### Prerequisites

To use these examples, you'll need a Scan Token for the FossID Knowledge Base. You can retrieve the token from your account's [Evaluation Portal](https://vault-eu.foss.id/eval) or [Delivery Portal](https://vault-eu.foss.id/delivery).

If you're unsure how to access these sites, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com).
