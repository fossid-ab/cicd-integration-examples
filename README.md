# About this Repo
The purpose of this repo is to share examples of how FossID can be added to your CI/CD pipelines.
There are two tools for which we'll provide examples: The FossID Workbench and the FossID Toolbox.

## FossID Workbench
For Workbench, we'll provide examples using the [Workbench Agent](https://github.com/fossid-ab/workbench-agent).
We'll provide examples of using the Python Script directly or running the Workbench Agent container.

Please Note: The CI/CD examples are not complete build pipelines. They are intended to show only how FossID can be added to your own.

### Prerequisites
To use these examples, you'll need access to FossID Workbench, a User Account, and the User's API Token.
If you plan to run the Workbench Agent container, you'll also need an Image Pull Secret for our Quay Registry.
If you don't have an Image Pull Secret, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com) to request one.

## FossID Toolbox
For Toolbox, we'll provide examples using the Toolbox Container Image. 

### Prerequisites
To use these examples, you'll need a Scan Token for the FossID Knowledge Base. 
You can retrieve the token from your account's [Evaluation Portal](https://vault-eu.foss.id/eval) or [Delivery Portal](https://vault-eu.foss.id/delivery).
If you're unsure of how to access these sites, please [contact FossID Support](https://support.fossid.com).
